# Network Security - Malicious URL Detection using MLOps

A comprehensive end-to-end MLOps project designed to detect malicious URLs using XGBoost, ensuring user safety by identifying harmful links through machine learning. By combining data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring, it provides a complete solution for real-time and batch URL safety assessments.

## Introduction

Malicious URLs are links that lead to harmful websites, often used by cybercriminals through phishing emails, social engineering, and other tactics. This project detects malicious URLs using machine learning and provides both single URL predictions and batch predictions through an interactive UI.

2. **Pipeline Execution:**
   - Use **Airflow DAGs** (`network_training_dag.py` and `network_prediction_dag.py`) to orchestrate data ingestion, training, and prediction.

3. **Batch Prediction:**
   - Run the **FastAPI** server and use the `/predict` route to upload a CSV file and receive predictions in **JSON** format.

4. **Single Prediction:**
   - Launch the **Streamlit** app for real-time prediction of a single URL.

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Track all experiments, model metrics (e.g., F1-score, Precision), and logs via the **MLflow UI**.
